Through observation of individuals throughout New York City, one noticeable characteristic
shared among many is the shoulder bag carried at their side. From light to heavy, this book
documents the weights on their shoulders, analyzing the effect of this shared feature among strangers in New York City. Distinct individual features are blurred out, focusing solely on the weight they carry.

 	Gait is a body movement pattern wherein the nervous and musculoskeletal systems, among others, are comprehensively used based on human body movements. These processes are basic forms of movements in which the center of the body is moved through the lower limbs, pelvis, trunk, upper limbs, and for interconnectivity, resulting in continuous and repetitive motions that require high degrees of coordination. <br/><br/>
 	In the present study, using the G-Walk gait analyzer (BTS Bioengineering SpA, Italy), pelvic movements are examined with loads of 5%, 10%, and 15% of body weight and with different shapes of bags.

 		In the present study, since bag weights were determined to potentially have an effect relative to subjects’ force or physical strength, weights corresponding to 5%, 10%, and 15% of the subject’s body weight were applied, instead of identical weights. These weights were loaded into four shapes of bags to examine their effects on pelvic tilts and rotation. Changes in leftward or rightward pelvic tilts showed a tendency to increase as the weight increased when a load was placed on one side via a hand bag or shoulder bag.
